# Aardvark: A Solution for Information and Truth 

Aardvark is a fact-checking and opinion aggregation platform designed to help users validate
claims, discuss statements, and gain insights from community perspectives. With the Aardvark
Chrome Extension, users can highlight and comment on text across any website. The platform's
backend then uses AI to analyse and summarise the community's opinions, providing real-time
insights into contested or frequently discussed statements.
